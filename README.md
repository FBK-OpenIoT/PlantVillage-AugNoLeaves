## Abstract
To be put after final submission

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset is a refined and augmented version of the PlantVillage dataset, extended to include a "no leaves" class representing background-only images. All data was processed into three broad categories for training an edge-AI model:

- **Unhealthy**: 43,875 images  
- **Healthy**: 16,468 images  
- **No Leaves (Background)**: 15,325 images  

📌 **Total images**: 75,668  
📌 **Number of original classes**: 39

Each original class was mapped into one of the following categories:

- `healthy`
- `unhealthy`
- `no leaves`

### 🌿 Sample Classes by Category

This table categorizes plant images into **Healthy**, **Unhealthy**, and **No Leaves** classes, commonly used for training classification models in plant pathology datasets.

| **Healthy**                | **Unhealthy**                                     | **No Leaves**                  |

## 🚀 Getting Started


### 📦 Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (`python --version`)
- pip package manager (`pip --version`)
- pandas
- Dataset in PlantVillage-AugNoLeaves.zip


### ⚙️ Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
`It may take a few minutes.`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FBK-OpenIoT/PlantVillage-AugNoLeaves.git
cd PlantVillage-AugNoLeaves
unzip PlantVillage-AugNoLeaves.zip
cd PlantVillage-AugNoLeaves-Dataset
```

2. Make sure your dataset is structured like this:
```bash
dataset_path/
├── Apple___healthy/
├── Apple___Black_rot/
├── Background_without_leaves/
├── ...
```

3. Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv plantenv
source plantenv/bin/activate
```

4. Install Required Packages:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas
```


### 🌱 Dataset Preparation
5. Load the Dataset:
```bash
# Path to the dataset
dataset_path = dataset_path = '/path/to/your/dataset/'
image_size = (128, 128)
batch_size = 8
valid_extensions = ('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')

# Define healthy and unhealthy plant classes
healthy_classes = [
    'Strawberry___healthy', 'Blueberry___healthy', 'Peach___healthy',
    'Apple___healthy', 'Tomato___healthy', 'Corn___healthy',
    'Soybean___healthy', 'Raspberry___healthy', 'Grape___healthy',
    'Pepper,_bell___healthy'
]
no_leaves_classes = ['Background_without_leaves']
all_classes = os.listdir(dataset_path)

# Create a mapping for labels: "healthy", "unhealthy", or "no leaves"
unhealthy_classes = [cls for cls in all_classes if cls not in healthy_classes + no_leaves_classes]
label_mapping = {cls: "healthy" for cls in healthy_classes}
label_mapping.update({cls: "unhealthy" for cls in unhealthy_classes})
label_mapping.update({cls: "no leaves" for cls in no_leaves_classes})
```

6. Function to collect data from the dataset directory:
```bash
def collect_data(dataset_path):
    file_paths = []
    labels = []
    
    for label_folder in all_classes:
        if label_folder in label_mapping:  # Only process folders in label_mapping
            class_label = label_mapping[label_folder]
            label_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, label_folder)

            if os.path.isdir(label_path):
                image_files = os.listdir(label_path)
                print(f"Processing {len(image_files)} images from class: {class_label}")

                for image_file in image_files:
 
                    if not image_file.startswith('.') and image_file.lower().endswith(valid_extensions):
                        image_path = os.path.join(label_path, image_file)
                        file_paths.append(image_path)
                        labels.append(class_label)
                    else:
                        print(f"Warning: Skipping non-image or hidden file {image_file}")
    
    return pd.DataFrame({'file_path': file_paths, 'class': labels})
df = collect_data(dataset_path)
```

7. Print class distribution in the dataset:
```bash
# Print class distribution in the dataset
print(f"📌 Total images found: {len(df)}")
print("📌 Class distribution:")
print(df['class'].value_counts())
```
